Alright here I go, brace yourself. I recommend you read it all, but going to divide it into sections nonetheless.

# Foreword

Wow, this has been so much fun to write, almost therapeutic. I hope you enjoy it.

## Origins

First of all, Gibraltar's "Rock" is one of the Pillars of Hercules, how cool is that. They called it "Mons Calpe", and nowadays there's several places around Gib named after that - including a football club! Current name dates from the year 711 when Arabs started their conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, "Ŷabal Tāriq", Yabal's Mount.

That year they entered through Gibraltar, but didn't establish there, instead they built the city of Algeciras, at the other side of Gibraltar's Bay. Gibraltar's fort was actually built much later, in 1160.

Fast forward several hundred years and the Christians had almost finished getting back the Iberian Peninsula from the Arabs. In 1379, Algeciras' king, fearing the imminent Christian invasion of the city, decides to completely destroy it instead.

Gibraltar would remain Arab until 1462, when the Christians captured it, totaling 302 years of Arab domain. In 1704, 242 years later, the English took it, and to this day, 318 years later, part of the Spanish population is still sore about it, in spite of the fact that it was Arab for longer than it was Spanish, and it has now been English for the longest.

## Modern age

The Spanish population of Gibraltar fled the city. The majority of it gathered around the nearby hermitage of San Roque, founding a city by the same name which, to this day, keeps its original motto, as depicted by a huge sign at his entrance: "City of San Roque, where that of Gibraltar resides".

The remainder of Gibraltar's Spanish population settled around the destroyed city of Algeciras and started rebuilding it. The Spanish start calling its bay the Bay of Algeciras, and they still do, even though the rest of the world calls it the Bay of Gibraltar.

In 1730 the Spanish start building a wall at the border between Gibraltar and Spain. They call it "La Línea" - the line. This wall is destroyed in 1810 ahead of the French invasion, but the city that formed next to it survived to this day: "La Línea de la Concepción".

## Contemporary era

Fast forward ~100 years. WW2 starts. The Spanish dictatorship being in friendly terms with Hitler, Gibraltar becomes a hotspot. Civilian population is evacuated from both Gibraltar and La Linea, and both sides are heavily armed.

Luckily Spain remained neutral throughout the war and conflict never arose. Nowadays WW2 facilities are famous tourist attractions at both sides, with bunkers scattered across La Linea and the Rock being hollowed by more than 50 kilometers of war tunnels.

After the war, civilians returned to both cities. 20 years later, Spanish dictator proposes the return of Gibraltar to Spain. Gibraltarians vote against it in the 1967 referendum. As a response, Spain completely closes the border with Gibraltar.

It would remain fully closed until 1982. Pause to think about this for a second. That's just 40 years ago. Every Gibraltarian in their 50s and above lived through this. And their children have been told stories about it.

Everybody knows about the Berlin Wall, but few know about what happened in Gibraltar, even though both things happened at roughly the same time. Overnight, the entangled fates of two cities that are really just one, were severed by a 100-meters wide border. 

Phone lines were shut. Families would arrange meetings at the border with weeks of preparation ahead of them, as letters went from Gib to Africa and then to Spain, with the same journey to get back to Gib.

Then as both sides of the family met at the same point of the border's length, they would shout at each other to be heard from the other side. Grandparents would look at their newborn grandchildren from 100 meters away.

It's no wonder why the Gibraltarians resent the Spanish after going through all that. The Spanish on the other hand can only justify their hatred on a deluded sentiment of patriotism germinated during the dictatorship.

And nonetheless "getting Gibraltar back" is one of Spain's favourite topics of political discussion. Well, one thing I can tell you: no Gibraltarian will ever agree to be sided with those who put their parents through such hardships, and if you ask me, Spanish authorities should just do two things: apologize and leave them alone[^1].

[^1]: No pun intended. Don't you dare isolate them again.
